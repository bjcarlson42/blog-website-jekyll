## Introduction
When I first started programming, it was hard to decide what technologies, languages, and tools to learn. There were so many different technologies out there and finding the right one for the job sometimes seemed impossible. If you wanted to make a clone of Instagram (or any social media app) how would you build it? What framework would you use (if any)? What database? How would you connect the two? What language would you write the app in? These are only some of the questions that you will ask yourself before eventually going down a rabbit hole of learning so many different technologies yet mastering none of them.
