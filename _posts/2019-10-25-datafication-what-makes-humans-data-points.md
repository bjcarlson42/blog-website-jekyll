## Introduction
Data is all around us and has been growing at an exponential rate in the past couple of years. Social media sites like Twitter and Instagram, activity trackers like Fitbits, and even your smart car are collecting data that can be used to predict things. In this post I will go over what datafication is and how it is affecting you every day even when you probably donâ€™t even realize it. Note: This was originally an assignment for my applied analytics for data science class but I have modified it for this post.
