## Introduction
Data is all around us and has been growing at an exponential rate in the past couple of years. Social media sites like Twitter and Instagram, activity trackers like Fitbits, and even your smart car are collecting data that can be used to predict things. In this post I will go over what datafication is and how it is affecting you every day even when you probably don’t even realize it. Note: This was originally an assignment for my applied analytics for data science class but I have modified it for this post.

## What is Datafication?
Datafication can be defined as a technological trend turning many aspects of our lives into data which is subsequently transferred into information realized as a new form of value. In simple terms this is saying everything we do can be recorded and turned into data. This data can then be analyzed in many different ways. The driving force behind datafication is the “Internet of things”. 

## What is the Internet of Things?
The “Internet of things”(IoT) is the driving force behind datafication. The IoT includes billions of devices all around us that are connected to the internet, collecting and sharing billions and billions of data. The list of devices that are part of the IoT is constantly growing and includes some of the following including, smart TV’s, smart watches, phones, and many many more. Using the IoT we can convert all sorts of things into a data format. Some examples of this are monitoring a parking spot, monitoring a person’s health, or monitoring a person’s streaming habits. 

Social media is another great example. Twitter “datafyes” our thoughts and linkedIn “datafyes” our professional accomplishments. All of this new data that is being collected can be used to make new insights with unprecedented value. This is a simple explanation of the IoT. If you want me to make a separate post on the IoT, leave a comment on this post!

## Advantages
All this datafication leads to several advantages in our lives. 

1. One advantage is with advertisements. The more a site like google or instagram knows about a person and their buying or viewing habits, the more ads can be given that relate to that specific user. This can lead to the user having a better experience browsing the web. A good example of this is from an excerpt I found in an article about datafication titled “What’s really behind the big data hype” by Bernard Marr. In this quote, we see how Walmart is using datafication to collect all sorts of data from its customers and how it uses that information. If this doesn’t show you how powerful datafication is, I’m not sure what will.  

> "Wal-Mart is able to take data from your past buying patterns, their internal stock information, your mobile phone location data, social media as well as external weather information and analyse all of this in seconds so it can send you a voucher for a BBQ cleaner to your phone– but only if you own a barbeque, the weather is nice and you currently are within a 3 miles radius of a Wal-Mart store that has the BBQ cleaner in stock." 

2. Another advantage of datafication is simply having so much data. With all this new data, companies need to hire more people that are skilled enough to analyze this data therefore creating new job titles and openings. One job in particular is a data scientist. A data scientist is described by the Oxford dictionary “as a person employed to analyze and interpret complex digital data, such as the usage statistics of a website, especially in order to assist a business in its decision-making.”

## Disadvantages
Of course there are also disadvantages when talking about datafication.

1. One such example is the fact that a device is always listening to you. A lot of smart devices are recording audio at all times and you don’t even realize it. Amazon Echo, Google Home, and your mobile phone are recording at all times. A personal example of this happened a few months ago. I had learned that anyone has the ability to download your own personal data from google. This was especially interesting to me because I use a google pixel 2xl for my mobile phone so I had more google data than iPhone users such as location history, and google assistant history. When I downloaded the data, I explored all the files. One file that I found interesting was all of my google assistant questions. I found all the audio files of everything I had ever asked my assistant. One thing I found interesting was the recording started with a second of pause and then me saying “OK Google”. This means that my phone was recording even before I said “OK Google” to activate the assistant. Although allowing devices to listen all the time lets the company know more about the user, it can also potentially lead to privacy concerns. Are google employees listening to our dinner conversations? I sure hope not.

2. Secondly, having all this data can be disastrous if it is faulty. If companies have a bunch of data that they rely on and make decisions on and eventually find out that the data was wrong or misleading, it could cost the company lots of money. Trusting too much in the data is also bad.

## Wrapping Up
With all this in mind, I believe that society will overall benefit from datafication. As we have seen so far, there are many applications for datafication. It can give us better shopping experiences online or pave the way for many new jobs and even new fields. Datafication may one day even power self driving cars. I think it is safe to say that datafication will continue to be a buzz word for quite some time.
