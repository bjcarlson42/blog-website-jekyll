## Introduction
Hello and welcome to this website! It has always been a dream of mine to share things I am passionate about with the
world. I am finally taking that dream and turning it into a reality by starting this website. As you read through this post, you will learn more about me, my experiences, and what you, the reader, will get out of this site.
I hope you enjoy!

## About Me
First things first, let me introduce myself. My name is Benjamin Carlson. I am currently a sophomore at
                Bryant
                University in Smithfield, RI pursuing a degree in Data Science with a minor in Business Administration.
                I grew up in
                Middletown, Connecticut and I am one of three other siblings. Growing up, I played a lot of sports
                including
                baseball,
                soccer, basketball, cross country, and track.

### High School
In high school I was very active, joining many organizations both inside and outside of school. I was a
            member of
            marching, concert, and jazz band, cross country, indoor and outdoor track, pride leaders, and co-founder of
            the cubing
            club. Outside of school I was a part of my church’s Peer Ministry group and Boy Scouts where I earned the
            prestigious
            rank of Eagle Scout.

### College
In college I run Division 1 cross country and track, played in the pep band, and am part of the Data Science
            Association. If you would rather see a visual timeline of my history, check out the about section of my
            website or the
            about section of this website!

## Coding Experience
Because this website will be all about coding (and the world around it), it’s important that you know that
            the person
            teaching you how to code is knowledgeable and knows what they are doing. So before we go any further, here
            is some of my
            programming experience.

I took my first Computer Science class senior year of high school. I instantly fell in love and have been
            programming
            constantly since then. Some of the classes I have taken (or am taking now) include Infrastructure and Cloud
            Computing,
            Web Design and Development (Honors), Applied Analytics (Data Science focus), Introduction to Programming,
            Programming
            for Analytics, Statistics 1, Statistics 2, Calculus 1, and SAS Programming. I have also taught myself over
            the past year
            or so web design and development. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and some web frameworks all during my free
            time.

### Computer Science Internships
Along with these classes I also have two internships under my belt, both in the computer science field. The
            first was an
            I.T. internship for my town’s City Hall. Here my main tasks were to secure disposal of hard drives and other
            electronics, remove security cameras, printers and electronic inventory, and respond to City Hall Worker’s
            I.T. related
            questions.

The following summer I had the opportunity to intern at The Law Forum LLC. Here I worked with the software
            development
            team to generate reports using C# linq queries, updated existing sites using git for version control, worked
            closely
            with their database using SQL queries, and oversaw website development from start to finish from a technical
            and
            business standpoint. As you can see from this, I have a pretty extensive knowledge base.

### I’m Mostly Self Taught
As a self taught programmer myself, I have picked up lots of tips and tricks along the way. I have also done
            some things
            that looking back, was not the best way to go about doing it. I hope to share these good practices along
            with the
            mistakes with you so you can have the best self taught programming experience possible.

## The Future of This Website
Enough about me, let’s look at where I plan to take this site. My goal is to post weekly. These posts could
            be coding
            tutorials, computer science related news, or something else. Regarding the tutorials, they will start off as
            beginner
            tutorials. For anyone who many not be a beginner, don’t worry. The tutorials will get challenging (and
            exciting) fast!

### Why Should you Code
In this day and age, everything from video games, driving to work, and even taking a hot shower is powered
            by code.
            Knowing how to code is beginning to switch from an option to a necessity. Learning how to code is important
            in so many
            ways but here are three reasons to learn.

1. Knowing how to code makes you stand out to employees. If you are a college student, every person that you
            are
            competing with for a job has a decent GPA and some extracurriculars. You need a way to stand out to
            employers. Knowing
            how to code is a great way! Creating personal projects and showing employers that you have the motivation
            and drive to
            learn on your own is a great way to show companies that you will flourish at their company. If you’re not a
            college
            student, it’s still a great way to stand out from your co-workers!

2. You can build whatever app, website, or program you have ever dreamed of building for free. Have you ever
            had an idea
            for a mobile game that you couldn’t make a reality because you didn’t have the money to hire someone to make
            it for you
            and you didn’t know how to code it yourself? Following along with my tutorials will give you the skills to
            make that app
            or even the next big tech startup!

3. Coding is fun! Learning how to code will not only make you a better candidate for any job, it’s also fun.
            The only
            way to learn something well is to have fun doing it. If you enjoy learning to code you are already ahead of
            most.
            Because of this philosophy, I am going to try and make these tutorials as fun as possible.

### More Than Tutorials
Knowing how to code isn’t all that this website will offer. There is so much happening in this world today
            that is
            related to computer science but does not require knowing code to understand, which is why along with coding
            tutorials I
            also plan to post about a variety of things computer science related. Some topics that interest me and that
            I could post
            about are data science, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and self driving cars just to name a few.

## Why Python?
Hopefully at this point you are getting excited about learning how to code and you may be asking what
            language we will
            learn first? If you do a quick google search of “What’s the best programming language to learn first” you
            will find a
            ton on overwhelming results. If you read through them you will find that the answers vary tremendously.
            There is no one
            best coding language to learn first. You can make good arguments for some of them but at the end of the day
            it doesn’t
            really matter.

This is why when choosing a language to learn, I tried to think of the language that would give you the most
            bang for
            your buck. I didn’t have to think long to come up with a language. The language I will start teaching you
            first is
            Python. You have probably heard of Python before as it has been a big buzzword for quite some time now.

### Uses of Python
When I wanted to start a coding website for beginners this was the first language that came to mind for a
            few reasons.
            First, it is not hard to learn. You can write your first Python program and understand basic syntax in a
            matter of
            minutes! Second, it has endless applications. Analytics? Yes. Web Design? Yes. Mobile App Development? Yes.
            Data
            Science? Of course (this is arguably its main application).

One web framework, called Django, uses Python and Instagram is built on the Django framework! As you can
            tell, Python is
            a hot, in-demand language and is going nowhere soon. Learning Python will allow you to build so many things
            and
            understand so many computer science concepts and it won’t take that long to learn.

## Wrapping Up!
With all this said, I hope you all are as excited as I am to go on this journey and to begin or continue
            learning how to
            code. Be sure to sign up for my newsletter to be notified when a new post comes out and follow me on
